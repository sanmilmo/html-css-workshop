# Instructions

Fork this project then clone it using `git clone YOUR_FORKED_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL`.

Once the project is cloned you can open it using your code editor of choice (e.g. vscode) and work through the problems.

For each problem, you can create a submission folder in which you can put your solution. Don't check the solution unless you have successfully completed the exercise. Come see a T.C if you're stuck!
