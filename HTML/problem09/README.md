## Reference

Don't worry about styling at this point, we'll have other exercises for that

Use the `<label>` tag to make the text describing inputs clickable

```
<label>
    <input type="radio" required /> text
</label>
```

Make all input elements before the **Extras** section required with the required attribute

```
<input type="text" required />
```

Use the `<select>` tag for the pickup list

```
<select>
    <option selected="selected">Select One</option>
    <option>Option 1</option>
</select>
```
